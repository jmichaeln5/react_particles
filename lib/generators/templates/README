Some notes before you get started:

=================================================================================================

  ***** ADDING NEW COMPONENTS *****

  After creating new components import them into the previously mentioned javascript directory

  app/javascript/react_application/application.js

  or

  app/javascript/___NAMESPACE___/application.js

  You can do this by using exact paths to your new components
  For example:

    import './my_new_component.jsx'

=================================================================================================

  ***** DISPLAYING CHANGES *****
  
  Your JavaScript assets were bundled initially when running react_particles:install but,

  you MUST bundle your JavaScript AND precompile your assets after changes are made.

  If updates will not be displayed. So don't forget to do so before spinning up your server.

  To do this cd into the new JavaScript directory (app/javascript/react_application)

  Then run:
    $ yarn run build

    $ rake assets:precompile

  Finally:

    $ rails s

  Feel free to use an alias for productivity

    $ alias react-particles-start='yarn run build && rake assets:precompile && rails s'
