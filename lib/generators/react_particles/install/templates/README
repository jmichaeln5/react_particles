Some notes before you get started:

=================================================================================================

  ***** ADDING NEW COMPONENTS *****

  When creating a new component import it into the newly generated JavaScript directory

    app/javascript/react_application/application.js

    or

    app/javascript/___NAMESPACE___/application.js

  Import new components using relative paths
  For example:

    import './new_component.jsx'
    import './components/another_new_component.jsx'

  ***** DISPLAYING CHANGES *****

  React Particles is built on top of the jsbundling-rails gem.

  Your JavaScript assets were bundled initially when running react_particles:install but,

  you MUST bundle your JavaScript AND precompile your assets after changes are made.

  The following rake tasks have been added to lib/tasks/react_particles for this process.

  All are execution of commands are limited to React Particles but,

  are also executed when running javascript:[build | clobber] commands.

  $ rails react_particles:javascript:build
    =>  'yarn build'

  $ rails react_particles:javascript:clobber
    =>  'rm -rf app/assets/javascripts/react_particles'

  $ rails react_particles:start
    =>  'yarn build && rake assets:precompile && rails s'

  Feel free to edit the generated rake tasks
